                    When disasters strike in remote regions, missionaries are often the first responders, taking every
                    opportunity to share the hope they have in Jesus Christ. Likewise, RATOLF will care for those whom
                    society has rejected, including Orphan, Homeless, street children, and widows/ widowers. RATOLF will
                    provide shelter and protect persecuted believers and the families of Christian martyrs.
                </p>
                <p>

                    With the help from God RATOLF will provides missionaries and Individual with the resources they need for
                    compassionate outreach—resources like food for the hungry, medicine for the sick, provision for the
                    persecuted, and children’s homes for the orphan.

                    Community Empowerment
                </h2>
                <img class="about_img mobile" src="./image/empower.webp">
                <p>
                    What Is Community Empowerment according to (World Health Organisation, WHO)
                    Community empowerment refers to the process of enabling communities to increase control over their
                    lives. “Communities” are groups of people that may or may not be spatially connected, but who share
                    common interests, concerns, or identities. These communities could be local, national, or international,
                    with specific or broad interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ‘Empowerment’ refers to the process by which people gain control over the factors and decisions that
                    shape their lives. It is the process by which they increase their assets and attributes and build
                    capacities to gain access, partners, networks, and/or a voice, to gain control. “Enabling” implies that
                    people cannot “be empowered” by others; they can only empower themselves by acquiring more of power’s
                    different forms (Laverack, 2008). It assumes that people are their own assets, and the role of the
                    external agent is to catalyse, facilitate or “accompany” the community in acquiring power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Community empowerment, therefore, is more than the involvement, participation, or engagement of
                    communities. It implies community ownership and action that explicitly aims at social and political
                    change. Community empowerment is a process of re-negotiating power in order to gain more control. It
                    recognizes that if some people are going to be empowered, then others will be sharing their existing
                    power and giving some of it up (Baum, 2008). Power is a central concept in community empowerment and
                    health promotion invariably operates within the arena of a power struggle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Community empowerment necessarily addresses the social, cultural, political, and economic determinants
                    that underpin health, and seeks to build partnerships with other sectors in finding solutions.

                    Mission to the neglected ones and children from broken homes
                </h2>
                <img class="about_img mobile" src="./image/pi4.jpg">
                <p>
                    <span class="drop_cap">T</span>here are many children today who are vulnerable and have been exposed to
                    different kinds of abuse all over the world. Most especially in Africa where many governments don’t show
                    any caring for the children growing up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many girls, boys, andteenagers have been exposed to sexual harassment and manyare victims of rape and
                    different kinds of abuse. We have heard many stories of a father’s having sex with their daughter(s),
                    and unclesraping girls put under their care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All types of abuse and neglect leave lasting scars. Some of these scars might be physical, but emotional
                    scarring might have long-lasting effects throughout life, damaging a child’s sense of self, future
                    relationships, and ability to function at home, work, and school.Some of these scars still affect them
                    even when they get married. Only through prayers, the word of God,andmultiple Biblical counseling canthe
                    scars in the heart of abused and neglected children be cured
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our mission is to educate the neglected children and be responsible for their well-being. Some of these
                    neglected ones do not have the capacity to study in high school or the university, but we can educate
                    themto obtain anapprenticeship. Our organization will equip them with relevant types of machinery they
                    will need to set up their business in the future. As we all know apprenticeship is a system for training
                    a new generation of practitioners of a trade or profession with on-the-job training and often some
                    accompanying study. At the end of their study, we would give them a license/certificate to practice in a
                    regulated occupation or to own their own company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All these things depend on their vision and their dream. Learning apprenticeship is a way of empowering
                    the less privileged and these people can become great entrepreneurs in the future, by doing we are
                    building and positively empowering our generation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our mission is to support and gather resources to prevent child abuse and neglected ones in our
                    communities.

                Young people live in a society in which creating sustainable career opportunities is complex. Guidance
                is crucial to support motivated, smart career-choices and prevent early leaving from education and
                training for a number of reasons:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Students or their families may give priority to general education over RATOLF, while RATOLF pathways
                    might very well be the best fit for a student’s preferences, attitudes, and, learning style,
                    –allowing students to better explore their potential and take better advantage of career
                    opportunities. Guidance avoids the usual biases about learning pathways, putting the focus on
                    personal skills and interests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The vocational nature and often high level of specialisation in RATOLF mean that there are many
                    choices on offer within this learning track. Guidance can help in navigating through the many
                    options of RATOLFand the often complex application procedures.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Appropriate guidance helps young people understand their learning needs and career preferences based
                    on their strengths and characteristics rather than stigmatising them as “bad students” and
                    generating feelings of inadequacy. It can lead young people to have an active, engaged attitude to
                    education and learning in general.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Receiving adequate information about the RATOLFprogramme in which a young person is enrolled or for
                    the occupation he/she will be studying can contribute to a successful learning path. Such
                    information may be about the working conditions, the technical complexity of the programme and
                    occupation, or the jobs a programme can lead to.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Support during studies can also be key to a successful learning path. Such support may involve help
                    with the choice of a specialization, the transition to the workplace (e.g. for work-based learning),
                    or networking into the occupational community, among other aspects.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

                RATOLF schools can help foster smart career choices and prevent early school leaving by providing career
                education and guidance at an early stage and promoting the development of career management skills.
                Career education can help identify and engage young people, especially the ones at risk of early
                leaving. It may be particularly useful to prepare transitions and it can help learners who are
                struggling with the programme they have just joined to continue successfully on their pathway or to find
                a new one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Career guidance is also suitable to help reengage early leavers from education and training. Career
                guidance services, employment services or social services are well placed to provide career guidance to
                low-qualified young people.

                    Guidance activities can be delivered by professional and engaged career guidance practitioners or
                    other professionals (e.g., teachers) operating at learning providers, careers services, public
