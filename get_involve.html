Sharing the Love of Christ

Following the example of Jesus Christ, who met people’s physical needs along with their spiritual needs, we provide help to those who are needy and suffering.
</p><p>
Following the example of our Savior, who met people’s physical needs along with their spiritual needs, we provide help to those who are needy and suffering through indigenous ministries.
</p><p>

When disasters strike in remote regions, missionaries are often the first responders, taking every opportunity to share the hope they have in Jesus Christ. Likewise, RATOLF will care for those whom society has rejected, including Orphan, Homeless, street children, and widows/ widowers. RATOLF will provide shelter and protect persecuted believers and the families of Christian martyrs.
</p><p>

With the help from God RATOLF will provides missionaries and Individual with the resources they need for compassionate outreach—resources like food for the hungry, medicine for the sick, provision for the persecuted, and children’s homes for the orphan.

Community Empowerment
</h2>

<p>
What Is Community Empowerment according to (World Health Organisation, WHO)
Community empowerment refers to the process of enabling communities to increase control over their lives. “Communities” are groups of people that may or may not be spatially connected, but who share common interests, concerns, or identities. These communities could be local, national, or international, with specific or broad interests. 
</p><p>
    ‘Empowerment’ refers to the process by which people gain control over the factors and decisions that shape their lives. It is the process by which they increase their assets and attributes and build capacities to gain access, partners, networks, and/or a voice, to gain control. “Enabling” implies that people cannot “be empowered” by others; they can only empower themselves by acquiring more of power’s different forms (Laverack, 2008). It assumes that people are their own assets, and the role of the external agent is to catalyse, facilitate or “accompany” the community in acquiring power.
</p><p>
Community empowerment, therefore, is more than the involvement, participation, or engagement of communities. It implies community ownership and action that explicitly aims at social and political change. Community empowerment is a process of re-negotiating power in order to gain more control. It recognizes that if some people are going to be empowered, then others will be sharing their existing power and giving some of it up (Baum, 2008). Power is a central concept in community empowerment and health promotion invariably operates within the arena of a power struggle.
</p><p>
Community empowerment necessarily addresses the social, cultural, political, and economic determinants that underpin health, and seeks to build partnerships with other sectors in finding solutions.

Mission to the neglected ones and children from broken homes
</h2>
<img class="about_img desktop_and_tab" style="margin-top: 0px;" src="./image/images1.jpeg" >
<img class="about_img mobile" src="./image/images1.jpeg" >
<p>
There are many children today who are vulnerable and have been exposed to different kinds of abuse all over the world. Most especially in Africa where many governments don’t show any caring for the children growing up. 
</p><p>
Many girls, boys, andteenagers have been exposed to sexual harassment and manyare victims of rape and different kinds of abuse. We have heard many stories of a father’s having sex with their daughter(s), and unclesraping girls put under their care.
</p><p>
All types of abuse and neglect leave lasting scars. Some of these scars might be physical, but emotional scarring might have long-lasting effects throughout life, damaging a child’s sense of self, future relationships, and ability to function at home, work, and school.Some of these scars still affect them even when they get married. Only through prayers, the word of God,andmultiple Biblical counseling canthe scars in the heart of abused and neglected children be cured
</p><p>
Our mission is to educate the neglected children and be responsible for their well-being. Some of these neglected ones do not have the capacity to study in high school or the university, but we can educate themto obtain anapprenticeship. Our organization will equip them with relevant types of machinery they will need to set up their business in the future. As we all know apprenticeship is a system for training a new generation of practitioners of a trade or profession with on-the-job training and often some accompanying study. At the end of their study, we would give them a license/certificate to practice in a regulated occupation or to own their own company.
</p><p>
All these things depend on their vision and their dream. Learning apprenticeship is a way of empowering the less privileged and these people can become great entrepreneurs in the future, by doing we are building and positively empowering our generation.
</p><p>
Our mission is to support and gather resources to prevent child abuse and neglected ones in our communities.
