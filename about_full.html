    <p>
And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb.  In the middle of its street, and on either side of the river, was the tree of life, which bore twelve fruits, each tree yielding its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. Revelation 22:1-2
    </p>

EACH ONE REACH ONE, EACH ONE TEACH ONE until we become a powerful force across the nations.
Then He said to His disciples, “The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.” Matthew 9:37-38

         OUR Statement of Faith
    </h3> 
        
    <p>
        The Bible is the inspired, only infallible, and authoritative Word of God. There is one God, eternally coexistent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God the Father is the creator of heaven and earth and the sustainer of all things. There is but one God, infinite, eternal, and perfect in holiness, truth, and love. The deity of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, His virgin birth, His sinless life, His miracles, His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, His burial, His bodily resurrection, and His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and His return in power and glory.
    </p><p>
        He is the Head of His body, the Church. God the Holy Spirit convicts the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment unites man to Jesus Christ in faith, brings about the new birth, and dwells within the believer, enabling him to grow in sanctification and righteousness, and become a gift of God to the church. The salvation of the lost and sinful man, regeneration by the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential. The present ministry of the Holy Spirit, by who’s indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a godly life.
    </p><p>
        The baptism of the Holy Spirit, with the evidence of speaking in tongues, is available to all that believe in Jesus Christ, and will totally surrender their lives to the complete, perfect will of God. The gifts of the Holy Spirit (the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, faith, gifts of healing, working of miracles, prophecy, discerning of spirits, diver’s kinds of tongues, and the interpretation of tongues) are available through the Holy Spirit and are for the church today.
    </p><p>
        The fruit of the Holy Spirit (love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance) and the character of God must be evident in the life of every disciple as preconditioned for the resting and manifestation of the Seven Spirits of God (the Spirit of the Lord, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord) sent forth into all the earth ( Gal 5:22 & 23; Isaiah 11:1 & 2; Rev 1:4; Rev 4:5 and Rev 5:6).
    </p><p>
        Character is the stability of the anointing. Man was created in the image and likeness of God. Through the original sin of Adam and Eve, mankind fell from God and became sinful in nature. He is totally incapable of returning to God in himself and is lost without hope, except by the salvation of our Lord Jesus Christ, through His grace. The Church is the Body of Christ, whose task is to take the gospel to all men in all nations and make disciples of them.
    </p>
        
    <h3 class="heading_topic">
        The Spiritual Unity of the Believers in Christ Jesus.
    </h3> 
    <p>        
        We believe in healing, good health, and wholeness as God’s will for mankind. We believe in the corporate worship of believers in a local church and in witnessing our faith. We believe in stewardship of all assets evidenced in generous giving, offerings, etc. The resurrection to eternal life for believers and the resurrection to damnation for unbelievers. The consummation of all things including the visible personal return of Jesus Christ the resurrection of the dead and the translation of those alive in Christ into the presence of God. The marriage supper of the lamb, the Millennial Reign of Christ, and the final judgment.
